# Challenge - Responsive layout

A test repo to work through responsive layout techniques.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create your initial files (index, style. etc) and commit them.
3. Look in the designs folder, you will find jpeg layouts for mobile, tablet and responsive

The idea is to develop those layouts into html, css and later some javascript.
I suggest starting with the mobile layout and then working your way up to tablet and then desktop.

4. Make a start on the mobile layout, and keep me posted on progress or issues.

I will add instructions and advice as we go along.

Good luck!
